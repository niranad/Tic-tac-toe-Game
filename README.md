# TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
***

A Tic-tac-toe game written in pure (or vanilla) JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It implements a simple vanilla JavaScript state management system and the web session storage API to preserve the game state, allowing the progress (or current state) of the game to persist even after the page is reloaded or the user navigates back to and from the main page, provided a new game session was not started on the main page.
