## TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
This project is a challenge from [frontendmentor](https://frontendmentor.io). The game has a high level of difficulty. It implements a simple pure JavaScript state management system and web session storage API to preserve the game state, allowing the progress (or current state) of the game to persist even after the page is reloaded or the user navigates back to and from the main page, provided a new game session was not started on the main page.
